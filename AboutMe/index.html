        <h2>title of your poem/haiku</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for the haiku is meant to encapsulate the gentle sounds, warmth, and enticing aromas that fill a kitchen during the baking process.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Oven whispers hum,</i><br>
        <i>Dough dances in tender heat,</i><br>
        <i>Sweet scents embrace home.</i></p>




        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p>I personally enjoy engaging in any activity that keeps me moving, such as pickleball, running, and tennis. I mostly just play pickleball with my husband during the summer months. Last summer, I got into running and tennis and although both are difficult, they are overall enjoyable and help my mental health. </p>
        <p>Despite my fear of bugs, I enjoy hiking. I am relatively new to Utah and have still not scratched the surface on the outdoor hiking scene, but plan to make better use of the many trails here. Some of my top hikes I havenâ€™t done are the Y, Mt. Timp., and Mt. Nebo. Some hikes I have done and enjoyed are Stewart Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and Lambs Canyon. </p>
        <p>I really like to read, mostly fiction, but am not opposed to the occasional educational/self help read. As a kid, my favorite place was the library. It was a safe quiet place to hide away in a world of fantasy. I secretly wanted to be a librarian when I grew up. In any other free time I have, I like baking for other people and trying new bread recipes. My next baking venture will probably be making sourdough bread. </p>
